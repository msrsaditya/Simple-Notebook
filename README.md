# Simple-Notebook

Simple-Notebook is a minimal replacement for Jupyter notebook. It's designed to provide a lightweight and efficient alternative to Jupyter, offering only basic functionalities like adding new cells, removing existing cells, and executing code. Unlike Jupyter notebook which has like a million dependencies, Simple-Notebook only requires one dependency, "flask", making it easy to set up and use.

### Why Simple-Notebook?
Jupyter notebook has become bloated over time, requiring thousands of pip packages and often breaking with new versions. Simple-Notebook solves this problem by offering a streamlined experience with minimal dependencies. The output appears in the form of alert messages, reducing clutter and making the interface cleaner. Additionally, Simple-Notebook uses the "Jet Brains Mono" font for better code visibility and readability, supported by thousands of developers worldwide. Its minimalist design ensures that it just barely works, which is considered a feature rather than a bug. It's the antithesis of bloated software like Jupyter notebook, offering a simpler, more enjoyable coding experience.

### Features:

- Lightweight and efficient (literally vanilla JS)
- Requires only one dependency: Flask
- Basic functionalities: adding cells, removing cells, executing code, that's it!
